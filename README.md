This README outlines the client-side caching architecture for a PHP weather application. Client-side caching aims to improve performance and reduce server load by storing previously fetched weather data on the client side.<br> 

<b> Improved Performance </b>: Client-side caching reduces the need for repeated requests to the server, resulting in faster load times for subsequent visits.<br>
<b> Reduced Server Load:</b>  By caching data on the client side, the server experiences reduced load as fewer requests are made. <br>
<b> Offline Availability:</b>  Cached data allows the application to remain functional even when the user is offline or experiencing network issues.<br>
